# NodeBoat

Join us for the first ever NodeBoat conference aboard the Crown Seaways
cruise ship!

Ok, so this might be a little nuts, but we decided to take [a cruise to
Oslo from Copenhagen and back again][5] at the end of September - and we
want all our current and future friends to come.

We set out from Copenhagen at 4:30pm on Tuesday the 20th of September
and will arrive in Oslo, Norway the next morning. After spending the day
in beautiful Oslo, we'll board the cruise ship for our return voyage
back to Copenhagen where we'll arrive the morning after on the 22nd at
9:45am.

NodeBoat is an [unconference][6] and everyone is welcome of course.
We'll focus mostly on Node.js obviously, but don't let that hold you
back from participating.
